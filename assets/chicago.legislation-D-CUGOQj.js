The ordinance allows the issuance of multi-family housing revenue obligations to fund the project. The plan involves constructing a 6-story building with 45 family housing units and two 3-flat buildings with six 2-bedroom units. The project will be funded through tax-exempt revenue bonds, secured by eligible funds. The City Council has approved the sale of the project site to the borrower, New City Redevelopment Limited Partnership, who will jointly develop the project with CCC. The ordinance authorizes the issuance of bonds up to $22.5 million and delegates authority to city officials to determine the sale of bonds. The bonds are limited obligations payable from revenues under the indenture and loan agreement. The city intends to use bond proceeds to reimburse project costs. The ordinance also allows for the use of Chicago Recovery Program Funds and additional financing upon approval."},{id:"ocd-bill/3eb875b8-7246-4602-9b93-1ed934de57d9",title:"Expression of opposition to proposed rezoning of property at 2907-2923 W Irving Park Rd, App No. A-8852 (O2023-0003532)",tags:["Council Matters","Call for Action"],status:["Stale"],updated_at:"2023-12-13",statusDate:"2023-12-13 - Stale",sponsors:[{name:"Misc.
